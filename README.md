# House_price_predictor_AzureDeployment

This is a repository that contains Dockerfile and other sourcecode used to create a web based service that predict house prices in California (data used to train is outdated, however)

The service is hosted on Azure was available at: https://calihousepricepredictor.azurewebsites.net/ 
(terminated as a student's trial period has ended)

Unfortunately the actual model cannot be uploaded on GitHub as it is too large.
It can be recreate with a jupyternotebook in the datasets folder
put the pkl file in the app folder and make sure to check the Docckerfile and change the name of the model accordingly
