# House_price_predictor_AzureDeployment

This is a repository that contains Dockerfile and other sourcecode used to create a web based service that predict house prices in California (data used to train is outdated, however)

The service is hosted on Azure is available at: https://calihousepricepredictor.azurewebsites.net/

Unfortunately the actual model cannot be uploaded on GitHub as it is too large.
It can be recreate with a jupyternotebook in the datasets folder
put the pkl file in app folder and makesure to check the Dcockerfile and change the name of the model accordingly
